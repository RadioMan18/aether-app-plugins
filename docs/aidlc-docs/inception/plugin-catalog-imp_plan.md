### 2.2 Critical Path Analysis (CPM)

The Critical Path determines the minimum project duration. It is the longest path through the DAG.

- **Critical Path:** CAT-004 → CAT-008 → CAT-015
- **Total Weighted Duration:** 132.08 hours
- **Bottleneck:** CAT-004, CAT-001, CAT-015

Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path of least resistance (minimum weight) to the integration milestone:

- **Shortest Path:** CAT-011 → CAT-015
- **Weighted Cost:** 33.00 hours

## 3. Execution Strategy

> **Phase Gate Policy:** Each phase concludes with a mandatory **Testing Gate**.
> The gate must return **ALL GREEN** (zero errors, zero warnings) before the next phase may begin.
> If any check fails, the current phase must be remediated and the gate re-run.

### Phase 1: Backend & Frontend (CAT-001 to CAT-012)

**Tasks:** CAT-001, CAT-002, CAT-003, CAT-004, CAT-007, CAT-011, CAT-012

#### `CAT-001`: Data Broker API Extension (JSON Schema Validation)

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Estimated Hours | 12.0 |
| Complexity | 1.8 |
| Risk | 1.3 |
| Weight | 28.08 |
| Module | `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs` |
| Dependencies | None |

**Objective:**

Extend the core Data Broker in the Tauri host to support a standardized, read-only query API for cross-plugin communication. Integrate the jsonschema crate to validate incoming query payloads against predefined schemas before execution.

**Technical Approach:**

Integrate the jsonschema crate in Rust. Define static JSON schemas for allowed cross-plugin queries (e.g., todo:get_tasks, goals:get_milestones) in src-tauri/schemas/. Intercept incoming IPC requests in ipc.rs. Validate the payload against the corresponding schema before executing the query. Reject invalid payloads with descriptive, non-sensitive error messages.

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`
- `src-tauri/schemas/todo_get_tasks.json`
- `src-tauri/schemas/goals_get_milestones.json`
- `src-tauri/src/tests.rs`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Host successfully parses and validates incoming query payloads against JSON schemas.
- [x] Malformed payloads are rejected immediately with a 400 Bad Request equivalent IPC error.
- [x] Authorized, valid queries successfully return read-only datasets to the requesting plugin.

**Testing Requirements:**

Write unit tests in `src-tauri/src/tests.rs` to verify validation of valid and invalid payloads. Ensure that unauthorized queries are blocked and return appropriate error codes. Target 85% code coverage for the validation module.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Added `jsonschema = "0.33.0"` to `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
- Added `todo:get_tasks` and `goals:get_milestones` typed endpoints with schema validation.
- Tests cover valid and invalid payloads for both endpoints. Gate 1 passes.

No upstream dependencies — this is a foundational task.

#### `CAT-002`: Host-Mediated RSS Background Fetch Service

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Estimated Hours | 16.0 |
| Complexity | 2.0 |
| Risk | 1.5 |
| Weight | 48.00 |
| Module | `src-tauri/src/rss.rs` |
| Dependencies | None |

**Objective:**

Implement a secure, background RSS fetch service on the Rust host that reads feed URLs from a user-editable configuration file, fetches them, and writes them directly to the plugin's encrypted SQLCipher partition.

**Technical Approach:**

Create a background thread/worker in Rust using tokio and reqwest. Read feed URLs from a user-editable configuration file (feeds.json) located in the local app data directory (%APPDATA%/aether/feeds.json). Fetch XML feeds, parse them into a structured JSON format, and write them directly to the RSS plugin's SQLCipher database partition. Ensure the plugin iframe's CSP remains strictly set to connect-src 'none'.

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `src-tauri/src/rss.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/commands.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/schema.sql`
- `src-tauri/src/tests.rs`
- `plugins/rss/`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Background service successfully reads URLs and writes parsed feed data to the encrypted SQLCipher partition without blocking the main thread.
- [x] RSS Reader plugin frontend can list feeds, view items, mark read/starred, and trigger refreshes via Tauri commands.
- [x] Plugin is registered as a builtin with `network:outbound` permission.

**Testing Requirements:**

Write unit tests in `src-tauri/src/tests.rs` using `mockito` and `feed-rs` to verify feed fetching, parsing, dedup, and state transitions. Target 80% coverage for `rss.rs`.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Added `tokio`, `feed-rs`, `reqwest`, `mockito` dependencies.
- Added `rss_feeds` and `rss_items` tables with indexes to `schema.sql`.
- Added 8 Tauri commands for feed/item management.
- Plugin scaffold created at `plugins/rss/` with React + Vite and Activity Bar registration.

No upstream dependencies — this is a foundational task.

#### `CAT-003`: Host-Active Clipboard Streaming Service

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Estimated Hours | 10.0 |
| Complexity | 1.8 |
| Risk | 1.4 |
| Weight | 25.20 |
| Module | `src-tauri/src/clipboard.rs` |
| Dependencies | None |

**Objective:**

Implement a host-side clipboard listener that monitors the OS clipboard, filters for plain text/HTML, and actively streams changes to authorized plugins.

**Technical Approach:**

Use native Tauri clipboard APIs or a specialized crate (e.g., clipboard-master) to listen for OS clipboard changes. Filter out non-textual data (e.g., files, images, rich binary formats) to prevent performance degradation and security leaks. Stream plain text/HTML updates to the frontend via Tauri events. Expose a permission gate (clipboard:subscribe) in the plugin manifest.

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `src-tauri/src/clipboard.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`
- `src-tauri/tests/clipboard_tests.rs`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Host successfully detects clipboard changes and filters out non-text/HTML data.
- [ ] Changes are streamed to the frontend only if the active plugin has the clipboard:subscribe permission.
- [ ] A clear, non-intrusive visual notice is displayed to the user when clipboard streaming is active.

**Testing Requirements:**

Write unit tests in src-tauri/tests/clipboard_tests.rs to mock clipboard events and verify that only text/HTML data is propagated. Verify that permission checks correctly block unauthorized subscribers.

**Integration Notes:**

No upstream dependencies — this is a foundational task.

#### `CAT-004`: Independent Biometric Challenge & Auto-Relock

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Estimated Hours | 14.0 |
| Complexity | 2.2 |
| Risk | 1.6 |
| Weight | 49.28 |
| Module | `src-tauri/src/biometrics.rs` |
| Dependencies | None |

**Objective:**

Implement a dedicated biometric challenge handler for high-sensitivity plugins (Linked Notes, Password Vault). Ensure keys are zeroized and partitions are relocked immediately when the user leaves the plugin.

**Technical Approach:**

Extend biometrics.rs to support independent, named biometric challenges via Windows Hello (UserConsentVerifier). On successful verification, release the specific partition key from the Windows Credential Manager, unlock the SQLCipher partition, and hold the key in memory using the zeroize crate. Implement an explicit lock_partition command. Trigger this command from the frontend when the plugin iframe is unmounted, loses focus, or when the user switches active views. Zeroize the key buffer in memory immediately upon relocking.

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `src-tauri/src/biometrics.rs`
- `src-tauri/src/database.rs`
- `src-tauri/tests/biometrics_tests.rs`

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Opening Linked Notes or Password Vault triggers a dedicated Windows Hello prompt.
- [ ] Navigating away from the plugin immediately triggers the lock_partition command.
- [ ] Memory inspection confirms the partition key is zeroized and the database connection is closed/invalidated upon relock.

**Testing Requirements:**

Write unit tests in src-tauri/tests/biometrics_tests.rs to verify that the zeroize crate successfully clears memory buffers. Mock the Windows Hello API to test success and failure flows.

**Integration Notes:**

No upstream dependencies — this is a foundational task.
