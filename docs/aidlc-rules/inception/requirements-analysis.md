# Inception: Requirements Analysis

## Objective

Clarify and refine requirements for the Aether AppSuite modular desktop platform.

## Key Questions to Resolve

1. **Plugin manifest schema:** What fields are required in `manifest.json`?
2. **Default plugins:** Should Todo, Goals, and Journal be bundled or user-installed?
3. **Biometric fallback:** What alternative auth is acceptable when Windows Hello is unavailable?
4. **Plugin data isolation:** Should each plugin have its own database namespace, or share tables?
5. **Cross-plugin permissions:** How should users approve data-sharing requests?

## Artifacts to Update

- `docs/aidlc-docs/inception/tech_spec.md` — Module specifications
- `docs/aidlc-docs/inception/implementation_plan.md` — Task definitions and dependencies

## Completion Criteria

- All ambiguous requirements resolved
- Tech spec and implementation plan updated with answers
- User explicitly approves the plan before construction begins
